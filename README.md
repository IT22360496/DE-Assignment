# Digital Electronics Individual Assignment
This repository contains the instructions and submission for my Y2S1 Digital Electronics individual assignment.

## Summarised Assignment Description
Planned the automated operation of an electric water pump for a house with a 1000-litre overhead tank and 3000-litre underground storage. Designed a schematic diagram, created a truth table, and derived a simplified NAND gate expression for controlling the pump based on sensor inputs. Prepared a lab report detailing the implementation process. Focused on ensuring the pump operates only under specific water level conditions for both tanks.
